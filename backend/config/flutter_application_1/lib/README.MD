Create a new flutter app using "flutter new (whatever you wanna name it)" in the terminal and place all five of these files in the "lib" folder. That's all

To run the app, type "cd (folder name)" -> "flutter run"

EDIT: Files have been updated. UI is much better now and there's dark/light mode implementation
